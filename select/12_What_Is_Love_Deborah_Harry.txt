"What Is Love"

What is love, what is love?
Yesterday I knew what it was
What is love, what is love?

Well, I've been haunted by the invisible ties that bind
And it's impossible to get you out of my mind
So I'll be talking and texting till what seems like the end of time
And you know I'll be thinking of you and asking myself

What is love, what is love?
Yesterday I knew what it was
What is love?
Today I'm not so sure
What is love, what is love?
Maybe tomorrow I'll know what it was
What is love?

Why try? Why even bother to redefine?
All these feelings that have been flooding the water line
I'm still happy to know what it was like and I'll be thinking of
You and asking myself every time

What is love, what is love?
Yesterday I knew what it was
What is love?
Today I'm not so sure
What is love, what is love?
Maybe tomorrow I'll know what it was
What is love, what is love?

If you go wild I'll take my chances
I'll build a shrine to what romance is
I'll wreck my brain for some kind of answers coz even

What is love, what is love?
Yesterday I knew what it was
What is love?
Today I'm not so sure
What is love, what is love?
Maybe tomorrow I'll know what it was
What is love?
What is love?

What is love, what is love?
Yesterday I knew what it was
What is love?
Today I'm not so sure
What is love, what is love?
Maybe tomorrow I'll know what it was
What is love?
What is love?
