I know the game you'd like to play when you are asking:
"Will you come and dance with me"
It seems that you just get excited when you take me
For a ride and lie to me

It's not my concern
I just wanna let you do it, yeah
It's not my concern
I just wanna let you do it, yeah

You won't hurt my feelings
If you say goodbye
'Cause I'm gonna feel all right
You won't hurt my feelings
If you say goodbye
Are you gonna do it, do it...

What is love... Yeah yeah

It's what you like.

I see you're always trying to fool me but it's clear
That you just can't make fun of me
I got a feeling you are a fake,
But it seems there is no way that I can tell

It's not my concern
I just wanna let you do it, yeah
It's not my concern
I just wanna let you do it, yeah

You won't hurt my feelings
If you say goodbye
'Cause I'm gonna feel all right
You won't hurt my feelings
If you say goodbye
Are you gonna do it, do it...

What is love... Yeah yeah

It's what you like.
