Back-Back it-Back
Back it up
B-Back-Back it-Back it up
Back it-Back it up
Back it up

I've been searching high and low
For someone who can do it like me
She said "Fuck you, what you hear, keep out for what you know and you'll see."
(Back-Back-Back)

You've been sneaking on my mind
Keep messing up my head when I sleep
I know you wonder who comes to comfort she
(Back-Back-Back it up)

Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love
(Back it up)
What-what is love?
(Back it up, back it up)

Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love
What-what is love?
(Back-Back)

There's been lots of conversation about you and me
About the way that we see things and you don't agree
The tip of a bee sting is how you left me
(It's how you left me, how you left me)

I've been whipping high and low
For a little picket fence and my peace
Sometimes I wonder, who comes to rescue me?
(Back-Back-Back it up)

Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love (Back it up)
What, what is love?
(Back it up)

Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love (What is)
(Back it up)
What-what is love? (What is)
(Back-Back)

(B-Back it up, back it up)

(Back it up)

Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love (Back it up)
What-what is love?
(Back it up)
Break it down, fuck it up
Now I see what is love
(Back it up)
What-what is love? (What is, what is)

Back it up
